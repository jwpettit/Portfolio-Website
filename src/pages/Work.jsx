                                customers find breweries in areas around the
                                United States.

                                BrewHop is my Hack Reactor capstone project. I
                                worked on a team of 4 including myself, Holly
                                Quach, Sean Sainz, and Yanning Wang. The project
                                utilizes Yelp's API to search for breweries and
                                present them to the user. The site contains a
                                React front-end, as well as multiple
                                microservice API's which are built using a
                                combination of Django and Postgres SQL. Finally,
                                the project is containerized and runs via
                                Docker.

                                I was responsible for building the login and
                                logout forms, signup form, and implementing
                                refresh-persisting React Hooks which keep the
                                user logged-in through a refresh. I also built
                                the "favorites" microservice which stores a
                                user's favorited breweries in the backend. I
                                took the lead in styling the entire page,
                                largely utilizing Bootstrap components, and
                                designed most of the graphics. Currently, I'm
                                working on developing a wake function which
                                wakes the backend from sleep and indicates
                                progress to the user through visual cues such as
                                a loading bar.

                                Treampardy is a web game utilizing questions
                                from real episodes of Jeopardy!â„¢

                                Treampardy was co-developed by Cindy Chiang,
                                Lindsey Carlson, and myself. It is built using
                                React, and pulling game data from the
                                open-source API{" "}

                                The three of us worked collaboratively,
                                group-programming to build most of the game's
                                core functionality. I was personally responsible
                                for the modals which show the game's clues and
                                questions. In the time since, I have worked to
                                maintain it, refactoring some of the
                                data-fetching logic. I've also built out some ui
                                functionality, including a loading bar which
                                appears while game data is being fetched from
                                the API. The game remains a work in progress,
                                and on the to-do list are enhancements such as
                                multi-player functionality, and a game-over
                                page.

                                React front-end, a Django-REST API back-end, and
                                a Postgres SQL database. The project also uses a
                                poller to propagate data from the database.
                                Finally, the project is containerized, and runs
                                via Docker.
