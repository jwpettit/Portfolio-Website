                            Through my experience working as an industrial
                            designer, Iâ€™ve come to realize that I am naturally a
                            detail-oriented problem-solver who is passionate
                            about all things tech. From working on
                            human-centered design projects I tend to be very
                            user-focused in my solutions and am always learning
                            new tools and skills. In project work I am very
                            leadership-oriented and have extensive experience
                            managing projects with diverse stakeholders both
                            domestically and abroad.

                        <p>
                            During my time at Hack Reactor, I developed many new
                            technical skills. I'm always learning and lately
                            have been focused on getting into mobile
                            development.

                        <p>
                            I am a detail-oriented problem-solver with a passion
                            for technology and a focus on user-centered design.
                            With a background in industrial design, I have
                            experience managing projects with diverse
                            stakeholders both domestically and abroad. During my
                            time at Hack Reactor, I gained valuable technical
                            skills in software engineering, including experience
                            with JavaScript, React, Python, and Django.

                        <p>
                            More recently, I have been focused on mobile
                            development, learning and exploring frameworks such
                            as SwiftUI and React Native. I am committed to
                            staying up-to-date with the latest trends and
                            technologies in software engineering, and am excited
                            to bring my skills and passion to a new role.
