                            I'm passionate about crafting great products and

                            Through my experience working as an industrial
                            designer, Iâ€™ve come to realize that I am naturally a
                            detail-oriented problem-solver who is passionate
                            about all things tech. From working on
                            human-centered design projects I tend to be very
                            user-focused in my solutions and am always learning
                            new tools and skills. In project work I am very
                            leadership-oriented and have extensive experience
                            managing projects with diverse stakeholders both
                            domestically and abroad.

                            During my time at Hack Reactor, I developed many new
                            technical skills. I'm always learning and lately
                            have been focused on getting into mobile
                            development.
